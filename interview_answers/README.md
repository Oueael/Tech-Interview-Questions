4Q. Can you explain the difference between a hub, a router, and a switch.

4A.A hub connects multiple networks or computers together. A router does the same except it determines the best way to route data packets. A switch is a like a routers but uses MAC addresses to only send data to the device that needs it. 

5Q. What are the layers of the OSI model and describe each one?

5A. There are seven model layers:
	Physical: Hardware connections and physical data transfers.
	Data link: Manages between physical network nodes including MAC addresses. 
	Transport: End-to -End data transfer
	Session: Manages network sessions. 
	Network: Finds best way to move data through device addressing.
	Application: Manages applications services.
	Presentation: Transform data to application layer while dealing with compression and encryption.   

6Q. How would you find a device on a network?

6A. Ping, traceroute, or use network scanning tools.

7Q. How does traceroute work? How is it different from ping?

7A.  Traceroute identifies the each hop taken by data packets from the source to the destination. Ping measures the response time it takes to do a roundtrip of data transmission and network connectivity.

Ping: Measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the source to a destination and back. Mainly used to check network connectivity and response time.

8Q. What is ping?

Ping is a diagnostic that measures the response time it takes to do a roundtrip of data transmission and network connectivity.
