# ZIGSPHERE'S TECH INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

I've been in tech for a long time and have interviewed quite a bit from small to very large companies. All of the questions mentioned on this page are ones I have been asked for IT-related positions. Each time a question was asked, I'd write it down. I thought I would share these with all of you for those who are wanting to study for their next interview. Enjoy!

I would like to also collaborate with the public to get other interview questions that may be asked during a technical interview. Would you like to contribute? Please send me a pull request and I'd be happy to add it! I will also be providing the answers as well, so please feel free to add your answer to the answer directory.
